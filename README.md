# SolvdCourse

This repository contains Java classes created as part of the SolvdCourse project. It includes basic Java programs for educational purposes, focusing on algorithm implementation and fundamental Java concepts.

## Classes

### 1. `InsertionSort.java`

The `InsertionSort` class implements the Insertion Sort algorithm, which is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm for small arrays. The algorithm iterates through each element in the array, places it in its correct position relative to the previously sorted elements, and shifts the larger elements to make room for the current element.

### 2. `HelloWorld.java`

The `HelloWorld` class is a basic Java program that prints a greeting message to the console. This program serves as an introductory example of Java syntax and the structure of a simple program.


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Grzegorzboron23/SolvdCourse.git
