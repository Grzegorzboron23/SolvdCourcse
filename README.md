# SolvdCourse

This repository contains Java classes created as part of the SolvdCourse project. It includes basic Java programs for educational purposes, focusing on algorithm implementation and fundamental Java concepts.

## Classes

### 1. `InsertionSort.java`

The `InsertionSort` class implements the Insertion Sort algorithm, which is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm for small arrays. The algorithm iterates through each element in the array, places it in its correct position relative to the previously sorted elements, and shifts the larger elements to make room for the current element.

### 2. `BubbleSort.java`

The `BubbleSort` class implements the Bubble Sort algorithm, which is a straightforward sorting technique that repeatedly steps through the array, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the array is sorted. Although less efficient for large arrays, it is a good educational tool for understanding basic sorting mechanics.

### 3. `HelloWorld.java`

The `HelloWorld` class is a basic Java program that prints a greeting message to the console. This program serves as an introductory example of Java syntax and the structure of a simple program.
